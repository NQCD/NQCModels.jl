This package provides an interface for defining models for nonadiabatic dynamics.
Primarily, the package is intended to be used with [NQCDynamics.jl](https://github.com/NQCD/NQCDynamics.jl/)
but it is equally possible to use any of the models separately.

For details on the included models and implementation take a look at the [documentation](https://nqcd.github.io/NQCDynamics.jl/dev/NQCModels/overview/).
